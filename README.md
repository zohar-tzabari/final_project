Welcome to the project! This Read Me file will provide you with the necessary information to set up and run both the server and client applications.

## Server Setup
To set up the server, follow these steps:

-Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.
-Navigate to the server directory.
-Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary Python packages for the server.

## Client Setup
To set up the client, follow these steps:

- Download Expo by visiting the Expo website and following the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Install npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
- Navigate to the client directory.
- Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages for the client.
Running the Applications
Once you have completed the setup process for both the server and client applications, you can run them using the following steps:

Start the server by running the appropriate command in the server directory.

```sh
python server.py
```

Make sure the server is up and running before proceeding.

Launch the Expo app on your mobile device.

Navigate to the client directory and run the following command to start the Expo development server:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and display a QR code in the terminal.

Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using the Expo app on your mobile device. This will open the client application on your device.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run the server and client applications. You can now begin using the application as intended.
